# Data
## Data description 
For an accurate prediction of the magnitude of damage caused by accidents, they require a large number of reports on traffic accidents with accurate data to train prediction models. The data set provided for this work allows the analysis of a record of 200,000 accidents in the state of Seattle, from 2004 to the date it is issued, in which 37 attributes or variables are recorded and the codification of the type of accident is allowed, grouped according to 84 codes. The information can be extracted from it:
  1. Weather 
  2. Road Condition
  3. Light Condition 
  4. Speeding
  5. The consequence of accidents : Fatalities, Injuries, etc

The data is very complet and will be used so that we can determine which attributes are most common in traffic accidents in order to target prevention at these high-incidence points.
