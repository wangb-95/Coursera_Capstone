## Data description 
For an accurate prediction of the magnitude of damage caused by accidents, they require a large number of reports on traffic accidents with accurate data to train prediction models. The data set provided for this work allows the analysis of a record of 200,000 accidents in the state of Seattle, from 2004 to the date it is issued, in which 37 attributes or variables are recorded and the codification of the type of accident is allowed, grouped according to 84 codes. The information can be extracted from it:
  1. Weather 
  2. Road Condition
  3. Light Condition 
  4. Speeding
  5. The consequence of accidents : Fatalities, Injuries, etc

However, for this case study, not all the attributes are useful as the main objective is to predict an accidentâ€™s probability and severity. Therefore, the Dataset needs deep understanding and analysis before choosing the right attributes to reach our goal.

For example, SDOTCOLNUM, X, Y, LOCATION, INCDTTM, INCDATE, REPORTNO, COLDETKEY, INCKEY and OBJECTID are features that give descriptive and detailed information about an accident, and are then not relevant to predict the severity of an accident in general.

Moreover, EXCEPTRSNCODE, EXCEPTRSNDESC, PEDROWNOTGRNT, SPEEDING, INATTENTIONIND and INTKEY have a high number of missing data that would skew and bias our predictive model.
After selecting the appropriate features, the new Dataset is balanced and preprocessed before feeding it to a supervised machine learning model that will learn to predict in the future the probability of a car accident.
