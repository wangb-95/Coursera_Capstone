# Seattle: Understanding The street design, Driver Behavior and the Surrounding Environment Contribute to Crashes
## Intruduction / Business Problem
All around the world, roads are shared by many motorized vehicles that have made transportation faster and more comfortable while supporting many countries’ economic and social development. However, these vehicles cause a global problem. Car accidents are responsible for 1.35 million deaths on roadways every year. Almost 3,700 people are killed globally in road traffic crashes, where more than half of those killed are pedestrians, motorcyclists, and cyclists.

While Seattle has seen a 30 percent decline in traffic fatalities over the last decade, traffic collisions are still a leading cause of death for Seattle residents age 5 to 24. Older adults are also disproportionately affected, so this trend could grow as the population ages. To supplement the findings of the City’s Bicycle and Pedestrian Safety Analysis project and provide policy makers and engineers with actionable information for developing and implementing interventions, we need have a deeper study for Collision data from Seatle. 

The objective of this project is to define the problem, to find the factors that can have a relevant weight in the quantity and seriousness of the accidents, so that any organism, company or enterprise interested in reducing these figures, can focus the resources in points where these conditions converge.

My study will focus in three part: 
  1. How street design impact collisions possibility 
  2. How the Surrounding Environment Contribute to Crashes
  3. How the Driver Behavior contributes to Crashes
  4. What is the most correlative factor?
